Arc Target - Basic

This asset is a basic all in one Arc Target Decal script. It works with a basic additive material, line renderer and RayCast to create any variation of thin low performance cost Target Arc effect. The script allows to attach a decal 3D object or spot light with cookie as a target type. The Target reacts to any collider surface normal.
