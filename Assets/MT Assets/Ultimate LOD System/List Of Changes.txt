v3.4.4
	- Improved backend and simplification algorithm support has been extended to Unity Engine versions 2022 and newer
	  as well.
	- Some backend improvements were made and the Ultimate LOD System's custom simplification algorithm was updated.
	- Some changes were made to the ULOD library files in an attempt to avoid (rare) conflicts with the same libraries
	  present in other third party Assets.
	- IMPORTANT: If you get error logs after upgrading to this version of Ultimate LOD System, try deleting the
	             folder "MT Assets/Ultimate LOD System/Libraries" and then just re-import the Ultimate LOD System
				 into your project!

v3.4.3
    - In this small update, the tool has been updated to include links to the new MT Assets Community on Discord. You
	  can join the community for support, ask your questions, submit suggestions, and interact with the dev
	  community! Come be part of the community and make it even better!
	  MT Assets Community on Discord: https://discord.gg/44aGAt4Sv4

v3.4.2
	- Now the officially supported minimum version is Unity 2019.4 or higher. Support for this version of Unity or
	  higher will make it possible to add different new features and improvements in the future. This change also aims
	  to ensure that the tool can always have mature, stable and continuous update support!

v3.4.1
	- Full and official HDRP support added!
	- The Ultimate Level Of Detail component will now show the Current SRP detected, in the Inspector.
	- Some improvements have been made to the Ultimate Level Of Detail Optimizer.
	- Fixed a bug in the "ULODs To Be Ignored" list not working sometimes, in the Ultimate Level Of Detail Optimizer
	  component.

v3.3.1
	- Fixed a bug with the Runtime Camera Detector. Cameras that are destroyed during your game will not have a chance
	  to cause conflicts in the detector any more.

v3.3.0
	- Removing some legacy files that are obsolete.
	- Added a C# method so that it is possible to check if an Ultimate Level Of Detail component is being forced to
	  display a LOD.
	- Added a C# method so that it is possible to force the display of a level of detail, regardless of the 
	  distance from the camera.
	- Updated documentation to contain new changes.

v3.2.1
	- Fixed a bug that caused some GameObjects to scale and rotate incorrectly after converting from ULOD to Unity LODs.

v3.2.0
	- ****
	  WARNING:
	  - In this update, the Ultimate LOD System will receive some security adjustments and improvements. It is
	    recommended that you make a Backup of your project, before upgrading to this version.
	  - If you are already an Ultimate LOD System user and have a compilation error after upgrading to this version, delete
	    the "Libraries" folder under "MTAssets/Ultimate LOD System" and then import the Ultimate LOD System again!

	  >> For users of old version 1.0.3 or lower...
	  IF you are a user of version 1.0.3 or lower, it is NOT recommended that you update your project's Ultimate
	  LOD System to this version. The Ultimate LOD System has undergone several upgrades after version 1.0.3, which
	  will make this update incompatible with versions 1.0.3 or lower.
	  ****

	- The documentation has been completely redone and updated as well. Now the new documentation is more modern
	  and more beautiful, it can be found in the folder "_Documentation/Documentation.html" and you can open it
	  directly from within your Unity Editor. If your project still has the old "Documentation.zip" file, you can
	  delete it without any problems.
	- Some fields that were used only for internal codes, but which were not used for external scripts, were hidden
	  to avoid confusion.
	- The components have been rearranged in the Inspector's "Add Component" menu.
	- You can now convert an "Ultimate Level Of Detail" component to Unity's standard LOD system with "LOD Groups"
	  components.
	- Fixed a small bug that caused warning logs to be launched when undoing a Scan using ULOD in the Editor.
	- Some scripts have been reorganized.
	- Small optimizations and bug fixes were made in the simplification algorithm.
	- Compatibility of the simplification algorithm with the version 2021.X of Unity Engine has been improved.
	- Some small optimizations were made in the LOD renderer (on Ultimate LOD System Backend and removing legacy code
	  that is no longer used for a long time).

v3.1.2
	- Fixed some minor bugs and minor code changes.
	- Fixed an issue that caused some meshes to blur, in the 2020 version of Unity, in rare cases.
	- An option has been added so that it is possible to optimize the mesh resulting from the simplification made by ULOD.
	- A new static method (GetSimplifiedVersionOfThisMesh) has been added that can be called from any script in your
	  project. This method is intended to return a simplified version of a mesh that you provide as a parameter. This
	  method can be called at runtime as well.
	- The documentation has been updated to contain minor changes and additions made in this version.
	- Fixed an issue that caused the "-" buttons (remove an individual item) from the list in the "Ultimate LOD Optimizer"
	  component to not appear.

v3.1.1
	- ** WARNING: This is a major update for the Ultimate LOD System. In this update the Ultimate LOD System backend has
	  been completely redone from scratch, for several code improvements, focusing on further optimizing the code and
	  enabling some features described below. It is HIGHLY recommended that you back up your project, before proceeding
	  with this update, if you already use the Ultimate LOD System. **

	- Added the function to disable or enable the simulation of LODs only in the Editor and for a specific scene. This
	  is particularly useful for baking lightmaps in the Editor or for other purposes, such as comparison and so on.
	- The "Enable Lightmaps Support" option has been added to improve the compatibility of simplified meshes with lightmaps.
	- An option has been added to force the Ultimate Level Of Detail component to always display all scan settings, even
	  if there is an active scan on the component.
	- The Ultimate LOD System now supports scanning and generation of LODs at runtime as well. You can use the C# API to
	  check if a component has already performed a scan, as well as to undo or perform a scan.
	- A demo scene has been added that shows the scanning of meshes and generation of LODs at runtime.
	- Some organizations were made in the scripts.
	- Material culling has been removed from the system.
	- Renderer culling has been added to the culling mode.
	- It is now possible to define a different material array for each level of detail of each mesh after do scan.
	- The UI has undergone some minor changes.
	- The documentation has been updated to reflect the new changes.
	- Now the Ultimate LOD System has a new component called "Ultimate Level Of Detail Optimizer" that can be added to
	  the GameObject of your game character, and will optimize your scene, disabling "Ultimate Level Of Detail" components
	  that are too far away! The use of this component is completely optional, but using it can bring even more performance
	  improvements to your project, and it will also facilitate your optimization work, allowing you to add more things to
	  your scene!
	- New methods have been added to the Ultimate LOD System API, methods that allow things like, Scanning and creating LODs
	  at runtime, obtaining a list of all existing "Ultimate Level Of Detail" components of the scene, etc.
	- A new C# method has been added so that you can define a custom camera, however, this new custom camera will be automatically
	  applied to ALL ULODs components in the scene. Note that only components with the "Custom Camera" camera detection method
	  will use the custom camera you define. Ulods using another method of camera detection will continue to use another method
	  without problems. This can be very useful in situations of handling multiple cameras in a complex way, or multiplayer games.
	- Now, when using the "Ultimate Mesh Simplifier" tool, you will see a mesh preview interface after generating your simplified
	  versions, and in this interface you can save the generated meshes, or cancel and return to the editing screen if you prefer.
	- You can now change the pivot of a ULOD component. By changing the pivot, you can choose from which point the ULOD should
	  calculate the distance for LOD simulation and thus have better control. Consult the documentation for more details.

v2.2.1
	- Now the Ultimate LOD System has a new window so that you can generate simplified versions of a mesh, quickly and
	  easily, without having to go through the Ultimate Level Of Detail component. This can be very useful when you just
	  need to simplify a mesh, without needing LODs.
	- The distance detection and calculation algorithm was written to bring some stability improvements.
	- It is now possible for you to select the method that ULOD will use to detect the camera to calculate the distance
	  for simulating the LODs.
	- You can now define a custom camera for ULOD to calculate distances and perform LOD simulation.
	- Some optimizations and performance improvements were made in general.
	- Fixed a bug that caused LODs to not work correctly at runtime in URP and HDRP.
	- If you choose to detect the current camera that appears on the screen, the Ultimate LOD System will use its own
	  method to detect the camera that currently appears on the screen, ensuring greater compatibility and accuracy through
	  Unity versions and rendering pipelines.
	- The documentation has been updated to include updates.

v2.1.2
	- Some changes were made to the code. Aiming at some small improvements.
	- Some icons of the Ultimate LOD System have been redone for greater style.
	- The documentation has also undergone a slight reorganization of some topics.

v2.1.1
	- The Ultimate LOD System will now force the update to render the LODs automatically, if you provide a new mesh in
	  a "Ultimate Level Of Detail Meshes" component.
	- Some minor bugs have been fixed and some updates have been made.
	- The documentation has been updated to include new tips.

v2.0.1
	- Attention: In this update, several aspects, features and methods of the Ultimate LOD System have been updated
	  in order to improve the tool, so there is a small chance that you will have a problem with some existing scan
	  in your project. If so, just redo the scan on your "Ultimate Level Of Detail" components and everything will
	  be corrected and will work correctly. This is just a warning, in tests performed, this update did not show any
	  problems with older versions of Ultimate LOD System, however, I always recommend that you make a backup of your
	  project, before upgrading to this version.
	  **
	- The rendering method for the Ultimate LOD System has been updated.
	- The code has been updated to improve stability and organization.
	- Several small bugs have been fixed.
	- The documentation has been updated to reflect the new changes.
	- Now the Ultimate LOD System no longer needs to have a void "Mesh Renderer" component next to it.
	- A bug that caused mesh deformation and some error logs on the console during LOD changes, in some versions of
	  Unity, has been fixed. Please, if you still have any problems with error logs on the console, crashes or fast mesh
	  deformations during the LOD changes made by ULOD in Editor, after this update, please do not hesitate to contact
	  my e-mail address support "mtassets@windsoft.xyz". These problems did not occur during the game's runtime.
	- There have been some changes to the component UI to improve organization and functionality.
	- Now instead of clicking on the "View" button to view the distance of a LOD, you can click on one of the buttons
	  that appear ordered according to the amount of LODS you have chosen to create.
	- Now the Ultimate LOD System cull meshes far apart, after the last LOD level. You can choose how far the cullings
	  take place.
	- Ultimate LOD System now supports modularization of LODs. This means that now, you are no longer required to use
	  3 LOD levels every time. You can now choose from 1 LOD level, up to 8 LOD levels! There are LOD levels for all
	  needs and now you have more control!
	- Now, when modifying the viewing distance for each LOD, ULOD will automatically show you the distance on the scene
	  viewing camera. You also have buttons for quick access to view each LOD level.
	- Now the interface has become a little more intelligent, with some automatic parameter corrections.
	- You can now copy the distance parameters from the parent ULODs to the child ULODs.
	- Now the official version of the Ultimate LOD System, is 2019.3.x.
	- A bug that caused Unity to crash when changing the LODs of a Skinned Mesh Renderer, in version 2019.4.x has been fixed.
	- Now, the Ultimate LOD System will always give preference to the game camera, when simulating the LODs in the Editor.
	  If you are in game play mode, the camera that will be preferred will always be the game camera, instead of the scene
	  camera.
	- Now, the Ultimate LOD System, by default, will always leave the "Ultimate Level Of Detail Meshes" component on all
	  meshes scanned by it. Through this component, you can provide your own LOD meshes for each level, if you want, to
	  debug the meshes and do other types of actions. If you choose to undo the scan, these components will also be removed
	  automatically.
	- Fixed a bug that caused the Ultimate Level Of Detail Meshes not to work correctly for changing LOD meshes in some cases.
	- Some performance improvements have been made.
	- The "Ultimate Level of Detail Meshes" component, which is now automatically incorporated into all meshes scanned by the
	  Ultimate LOD System, now has a complete C# API, so you can change the LOD meshes that make up the LOD group of your mesh,
	  quickly, even at runtime.
	- A new global parameter has been added to ULOD. You can now define a global multiplier (which applies to all ULODs that are
	  components of all scenes). It is a LOD distance multiplier. As you increase or decrease this multiplier, greater distances
	  or shorter distances may be required, based on the distances you have configured in your ULOD components. The default value
	  for this multiplier is 1.0, which leaves all ULOD components working as expected and normal.
	- The C# API of the "Ultimate Level Of Detail" component has been improved with the addition of new methods.
